# Booking Flow - Critical Fixes Applied

**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** ✅ CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

## Executive Summary

Applied **5 critical fixes** to the booking system based on comprehensive audit. The booking flow is now significantly more secure, reliable, and user-friendly.

---

## ✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Fixed Vendor API Schema Mismatch

**Issue:** Vendor bookings API was trying to access non-existent `booking.date` and `booking.time` fields, causing undefined values in vendor dashboard.

**File:** `app/api/vendor/bookings/route.ts`

**Changes Made:**

```typescript
// BEFORE: ❌ Accessing non-existent fields
bookingDate: booking.date,    // undefined
bookingTime: booking.time,    // undefined

// AFTER: ✅ Extracting from datetime field
const bookingDateTime = new Date(booking.datetime);
const bookingDate = bookingDateTime.toISOString().split('T')[0]; // YYYY-MM-DD
const bookingTime = bookingDateTime.toTimeString().slice(0, 5);  // HH:MM
```

**Impact:**

- ✅ Vendor dashboard now shows correct booking dates and times
- ✅ No more undefined values in booking lists
- ✅ Proper sorting by datetime

---

### 2. Added Vendor API Authorization

**Issue:** Vendors could view other vendors' bookings by changing the `vendorId` query parameter.

**File:** `app/api/vendor/bookings/route.ts`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Added Authentication Middleware:**

```typescript
import { requireAuth } from "@/lib/middleware/auth";

export const GET = requireAuth(getVendorBookingsHandler);
export const PUT = requireAuth(updateBookingStatusHandler);
```

2. **Vendor Type Validation:**

```typescript
if (!currentUser || currentUser.userType !== "vendor") {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Only vendors can access this endpoint" },
    { status: 403 },
  );
}
```

3. **Use Authenticated User ID:**

```typescript
// BEFORE: ❌ Trust client-provided vendorId
const vendorId = searchParams.get("vendorId");

// AFTER: ✅ Use authenticated user's ID
const vendorId = currentUser.id;
```

4. **Verify Booking Ownership on Updates:**

```typescript
const booking = await Booking.findById(id);
if (booking.vendorId.toString() !== currentUser.id) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "You can only update your own bookings" },
    { status: 403 },
  );
}
```

5. **Enforce Status Workflow:**

```typescript
const validTransitions = {
  pending: ["confirmed", "cancelled"],
  confirmed: ["completed", "cancelled", "no_show"],
  completed: [], // Final state
  cancelled: [], // Final state
  no_show: [], // Final state
};
```

**Impact:**

- ✅ Vendors can only see their own bookings
- ✅ Prevents cross-vendor data leakage
- ✅ Enforces proper booking status transitions
- ✅ Better structured logging

---

### 3. Implemented Booking Cancellation

**Issue:** Customers had no way to cancel their bookings.

**Files Modified:**

- `app/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts` (Added PATCH endpoint)
- `models/Booking.ts` (Added cancellation fields)

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Added Cancellation Endpoint

```typescript
export const PATCH = requireAuth(cancelBookingHandler);
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Only customer who made booking can cancel
- ✅ Cannot cancel within 2 hours of booking time
- ✅ Cannot cancel completed/no-show bookings
- ✅ Tracks who cancelled and when
- ✅ Initiates refund for paid bookings
- ✅ Sends notification to vendor

**Cancellation Policy:**

- Bookings with status `pending` or `confirmed` can be cancelled
- Must be more than 2 hours before scheduled time
- Refund automatically initiated for paid bookings
- Vendor receives cancellation notification

#### B. Updated Booking Model

```typescript
// Added new fields to interface
cancelledAt?: Date;
cancelledBy?: string;

// Updated paymentStatus enum
paymentStatus: "pending" | "paid" | "refunded" | "refund_pending";

// Added fields to schema
cancelledAt: { type: Date },
cancelledBy: { type: String, ref: "User" },
```

**Impact:**

- ✅ Customers can now cancel bookings themselves
- ✅ Proper refund workflow in place
- ✅ Audit trail for cancellations
- ✅ Vendors notified of cancellations

---

### 4. Added Cancel Button in Bookings UI

**Issue:** No UI element for customers to cancel bookings.

**File:** `app/bookings/page.tsx`

**Changes Made:**

```typescript
function BookingCard({ booking }: { booking: Booking }) {
  const [cancelling, setCancelling] = useState(false);

  const handleCancel = async () => {
    if (!confirm("Are you sure you want to cancel...")) return;

    setCancelling(true);
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/bookings/${booking._id}`, {
        method: "PATCH",
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("accessToken")}`,
        },
      });

      // Handle response, show toast, reload page
    } catch (error) {
      // Show error toast
    } finally {
      setCancelling(false);
    }
  };

  const canCancel =
    (booking.status === "pending" || booking.status === "confirmed") &&
    new Date(booking.datetime) > new Date();

  return (
    <Card>
      {/* Booking details... */}

      {canCancel && (
        <Button
          variant="destructive"
          onClick={handleCancel}
          disabled={cancelling}
        >
          {cancelling && <Loader2 className="animate-spin" />}
          Cancel Booking
        </Button>
      )}
    </Card>
  );
}
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Cancel button only shows for eligible bookings
- ✅ Confirmation dialog before cancellation
- ✅ Loading state during cancellation
- ✅ Success/error toast notifications
- ✅ Refund status message if applicable
- ✅ Automatic page refresh after cancellation

**Impact:**

- ✅ Intuitive UI for booking cancellation
- ✅ Clear feedback during process
- ✅ Prevents accidental cancellations

---

### 5. Improved BookingForm Error Handling

**Issue:** Generic error messages made debugging difficult for users.

**File:** `components/booking/BookingForm.tsx`

**Changes Made:**

```typescript
catch (error) {
  let errorTitle = "Booking Failed";
  let errorDescription = "Please try again";
  let shouldRedirect = false;

  if (error instanceof Error) {
    const errorMsg = error.message.toLowerCase();

    // Specific error handlers
    if (errorMsg.includes("already booked")) {
      errorTitle = "Time Slot Unavailable";
      errorDescription = "This time slot has been taken. Please choose another time.";
    } else if (errorMsg.includes("unauthorized")) {
      errorTitle = "Session Expired";
      errorDescription = "Your session has expired. Please sign in again.";
      shouldRedirect = true;
    } else if (errorMsg.includes("network")) {
      errorTitle = "Connection Error";
      errorDescription = "Check your internet connection and try again.";
    }
    // ... 7 more specific error cases
  }

  toast({ title: errorTitle, description: errorDescription });

  if (shouldRedirect) {
    setTimeout(() => router.push('/signin'), 2000);
  }
}
```

**Error Categories Handled:**

1. ✅ Time slot conflicts
2. ✅ Authentication/session expiry
3. ✅ Network/connection issues
4. ✅ Service unavailability
5. ✅ Staff unavailability
6. ✅ Vendor inactive/closed
7. ✅ Invalid date/time selection
8. ✅ Generic with helpful message

**Features:**

- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Specific guidance for each error type
- ✅ Auto-redirect to signin on auth failure
- ✅ Better debugging with console logs

**Impact:**

- ✅ Users understand what went wrong
- ✅ Clear next steps for resolution
- ✅ Reduced support requests
- ✅ Better user experience
