# Fix Summary: "[object Event]" Runtime Error

## Issue

Next.js application was showing `[object Event]` errors instead of meaningful error messages.

## Root Cause

Event objects from React form handlers were being caught in error handlers and stringified, producing unhelpful `"[object Event]"` messages.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Utilities (`lib/client-error-helpers.ts`)

- ✅ Added `getErrorMessage()` - Safe error message extraction
- ✅ Added `isEventObject()` - Detects Event objects
- ✅ Added `normalizeError()` - Converts any error to Error instance
- ✅ Added `logError()` - Structured error logging
- ✅ Enhanced `installClientErrorHandlers()` - Global error catching

### 2. Fixed Error Handling in Components

- ✅ `app/forgot-password/page.tsx` - Replaced `String(e)` with `getErrorMessage(e)`
- ✅ `app/vendor-dashboard/page.tsx` - Fixed 8 instances of `String(error)` pattern
- ✅ `app/booking-success/page.tsx` - Fixed error logging

### 3. Installed Global Error Handlers

- ✅ `app/layout.tsx` - Added `<ClientInit />` component
- ✅ Catches unhandled promise rejections
- ✅ Filters PWA/Service Worker events
- ✅ Prevents Event objects from being logged as errors

## How to Use

### In any component:

```typescript
import { getErrorMessage } from "@/lib/client-error-helpers";

try {
  await someAsyncFunction();
} catch (error) {
  // ✅ Always returns a proper error message
  toast({ description: getErrorMessage(error) });
}
```

## Benefits

- ✅ No more `[object Event]` errors
- ✅ Meaningful error messages for users
- ✅ Better debugging with structured logs
- ✅ Consistent error handling across app
- ✅ Global safety net for uncaught errors

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The runtime error has been completely fixed and the application now has production-grade error handling.
