# Security Audit Report - RBAC Fortification

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Auditor:** Senior Full-Stack Architect  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted on the multi-vendor salon booking application's authentication and authorization systems. Two critical security vulnerabilities were identified and remediated. All API endpoints now properly validate user identity and roles from server-validated JWT tokens.

---

## Security Vulnerabilities Found and Fixed

### 1. **CRITICAL: Coupon API - User ID Spoofing Vulnerability**

**Location:** `/app/api/coupons/validate/route.ts`

**Vulnerability Description:**
The coupon validation and application endpoints accepted `customerId` from the request body without authentication. This allowed any authenticated user to:

- Validate coupons for other customers
- Apply discounts to other users' bookings
- Potentially steal coupon benefits from legitimate users

**Original Code (Vulnerable):**

```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const { couponCode, customerId, bookingDetails } = body; // ‚ùå customerId from body

  const result = await CouponService.validateCoupon(
    couponCode,
    customerId, // ‚ùå Using untrusted user ID
    bookingDetails,
  );
}
```

**Fixed Code (Secure):**

```typescript
export const POST = requireAuth(validateCouponHandler);

async function validateCouponHandler(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const { couponCode, bookingDetails } = body;

  // ‚úÖ Get customerId from authenticated JWT, NOT from request body
  const currentUser = (request as any).user;
  const customerId = currentUser.id;

  const result = await CouponService.validateCoupon(
    couponCode,
    customerId, // ‚úÖ Using JWT-verified user ID
    bookingDetails,
  );
}
```

**Impact:** **HIGH**

- Prevented unauthorized coupon usage
- Protected customer account integrity
- Eliminated discount fraud vector

---

### 2. **HIGH: Vendor Profile Update - Insufficient ID Validation**

**Location:** `/app/api/vendor/profile/route.ts`

**Vulnerability Description:**
The vendor profile update endpoint accepted `vendorId` from the request body and performed a check afterward. While the check prevented the exploit, accepting user IDs from the request body is a security anti-pattern that could be exploited if the validation logic is ever modified or bypassed.

**Original Code (Vulnerable Pattern):**

```typescript
const vendorId = sanitizedData.vendorId || currentUser?.id; // ‚ùå Accepts vendorId from body

// Check after the fact
if (currentUser.id !== vendorId) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Access denied" }, { status: 403 });
}
```

**Fixed Code (Secure):**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ ALWAYS use the authenticated user's ID, NEVER accept it from request body
const vendorId = currentUser?.id;

// ‚úÖ Security: Reject any attempt to pass vendorId in the request body
if (sanitizedData.vendorId && sanitizedData.vendorId !== vendorId) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Cannot update another vendor's profile" },
    { status: 403 },
  );
}
```

**Impact:** **MEDIUM**

- Hardened defense-in-depth approach
- Eliminated potential for future bypass vulnerabilities
- Follows principle of "never trust client data"

## Other Security Enhancements Implemented

### 3. **Password Leak Prevention - Data Over-fetching**

**Issue:** Multiple API endpoints were fetching User documents without explicitly excluding the password field.

**Files Fixed:**

- `/app/api/vendor/analytics/route.ts`
- `/app/api/vendor/profile/route.ts`
- `/app/api/staff/route.ts`
- `/app/api/admin/vendor-approval/route.ts`
- `/app/api/payments/verify-signature/route.ts`
- `/app/api/bookings/route.ts`

**Changes:**

```typescript
// ‚ùå Before: Password could leak to response
const vendor = await User.findById(vendorId);

// ‚úÖ After: Password explicitly excluded
const vendor = await User.findById(vendorId).select("-password");
```

**Impact:** Prevented potential password hash leakage in API responses.

---

### 4. **Database Index Optimization**

**Enhancement:** Added unique index on User email field for improved query performance and data integrity.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// models/User.ts
UserSchema.index({ email: 1 }, { unique: true }); // Unique email index
```

**Impact:**

- Faster authentication queries
- Prevents duplicate email registrations at database level
- Improved overall database performance

## Security Posture Summary

### ‚úÖ **Strengths Identified**

1. **Strong Authentication System**

   - JWT-based authentication with short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
   - Secure refresh token strategy with HttpOnly cookies
   - Token rotation on refresh for enhanced security

2. **Robust Authorization Framework**

   - Comprehensive RBAC system with granular permissions
   - Role-based permission mapping (Admin, Vendor, Customer)
   - Resource ownership validation middleware

3. **Proper Security Patterns in Most Endpoints**

   - Bookings API correctly uses JWT user ID
   - Reviews API validates ownership before operations
   - Staff management properly restricts to vendor's own staff

4. **Input Validation**

   - Zod schema validation on all API endpoints
   - Request sanitization middleware
   - Type-safe validation with TypeScript

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implemented on authentication endpoints
   - Configurable limits per endpoint
   - In-memory fallback when Redis unavailable

### üîí **Security Controls in Place**

- ‚úÖ JWT token verification on protected routes
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ‚úÖ Resource ownership validation
- ‚úÖ Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- ‚úÖ HttpOnly cookies for refresh tokens
- ‚úÖ CSRF protection with SameSite cookies
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error logging
- ‚úÖ User account suspension checks

## Recommendations for Future Hardening

### 1. **Implement API Request Signing** (Priority: MEDIUM)

Add HMAC request signing for critical operations like payments and refunds.

### 2. **Add Refresh Token Rotation Limit** (Priority: LOW)

Implement maximum refresh count to force re-authentication after X refreshes.

### 3. **Enhanced Rate Limiting** (Priority: MEDIUM)

- Upgrade to Redis-backed rate limiting for distributed systems
- Implement tiered rate limits based on user role
- Add exponential backoff for repeated failures

### 4. **API Key Management for Third-party Integrations** (Priority: HIGH)

When adding payment gateways or external services, implement secure API key rotation.

### 5. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** (Priority: HIGH)

Add optional 2FA for admin and vendor accounts to prevent account takeover.

### 6. **Security Headers** (Priority: MEDIUM)

Add security headers in middleware:

- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security (HTTPS only)

### 7. **Automated Security Scanning** (Priority: MEDIUM)

- Integrate SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, Snyk)
- Set up dependency vulnerability scanning
- Implement pre-commit hooks for secret detection
