# Business Type Dropdown Feature

## Overview

Added a dropdown selection for business types in the vendor onboarding and profile management, with predefined options and an "Other" field for custom business types. This improves search functionality and data consistency.

## Changes Made

### 1. Vendor Dashboard (`app/vendor-dashboard/page.tsx`)

#### Added Imports

```tsx
import {
  Select,
  SelectContent,
  SelectItem,
  SelectTrigger,
  SelectValue,
} from "@/components/ui/select";
```

#### Updated State

```tsx
const [profileForm, setProfileForm] = useState({
  businessName: "",
  businessType: "",
  customBusinessType: "", // NEW: For custom types
  businessAddress: "",
  city: "",
  state: "",
  zipCode: "",
  phone: "",
  description: "",
  amenities: [] as string[],
});
```

#### Predefined Business Types

```tsx
const businessTypes = [
  "Salon",
  "Spa",
  "Wellness Center",
  "Beauty Studio",
  "Massage Parlor",
  "Hair Studio",
  "Nail Salon",
  "Barbershop",
  "Makeup Studio",
  "Skin Care Clinic",
  "Other",
];
```

#### UI Changes

- **Replaced** text input with dropdown for business type
- **Added** conditional text input that appears when "Other" is selected
- **Smart loading**: When loading existing profile, if business type is not in predefined list, it automatically selects "Other" and populates the custom field

#### Save Logic

```tsx
const updateData = {
  businessName: profileForm.businessName,
  // Use custom business type if "Other" is selected
  businessType:
    profileForm.businessType === "Other"
      ? profileForm.customBusinessType
      : profileForm.businessType,
  // ... rest of fields
};
```

### 2. Onboarding Wizard (`components/vendor/OnboardingWizard.tsx`)

#### Same Changes Applied

- Added Select component imports
- Updated `ProfileFormData` interface with `customBusinessType`
- Added predefined business types array
- Replaced text input with dropdown
- Added conditional custom input field
- Updated save logic to use custom type when "Other" is selected
- Updated validation to require custom type when "Other" is selected

## User Experience

### For New Vendors

1. During onboarding, vendor sees dropdown with 11 predefined business types
2. Can select from common types: Salon, Spa, Wellness Center, etc.
3. If their type isn't listed, they select "Other"
4. A text field appears asking them to specify their business type
5. Continue button is disabled until they fill in the custom type

### For Existing Vendors

1. **Predefined Type**: If their business type matches a predefined option, it's automatically selected in the dropdown
2. **Custom Type**: If their business type is not in the list:
   - Dropdown automatically selects "Other"
   - Custom text field appears with their existing business type
   - They can edit or keep it as is

### Editing Profile

1. Vendor can change from predefined type to "Other" at any time
2. When switching away from "Other", the custom field is cleared
3. When selecting "Other", they must fill in the custom field before saving

## Benefits

### 1. Better Search & Filtering

- Standardized business types make it easier to filter/search vendors
- Common types are consistent across the platform
- Still allows flexibility for unique business types

### 2. Improved Data Quality

- Prevents typos and inconsistencies ("Salon" vs "salon" vs "Hair Salon")
- Easier to aggregate and analyze vendor data
- Better for recommendations and matching algorithms

### 3. Enhanced UX

- Faster input with dropdown selection
- Clear options reduce decision paralysis
- Validation ensures required information is provided

### 4. Backward Compatible

- Existing vendors with custom types still work
- System automatically detects and handles non-standard types
- No data migration needed

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

```
User selects business type
    ↓
If "Other" → Show custom input field
    ↓
On save → Use custom value if "Other", else use selected value
    ↓
API receives final business type string
    ↓
Stored in database (no schema change)
```

### Validation Rules

- Business type field is required
- If "Other" is selected, custom business type is required
- Custom field is hidden when not using "Other"
- Custom field is cleared when switching away from "Other"

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

1. **Admin Management**: Allow admins to add/remove predefined types
2. **Auto-suggest**: Show suggestions based on what user types in custom field
3. **Analytics**: Track which custom types are most common to add to predefined list
4. **Multi-category**: Allow vendors to select multiple business types
5. **Search Integration**: Add filters by business type on customer search/browse pages

### Database Considerations

- Current implementation requires no schema changes
- If adding category system later, can create separate categories collection
- Can map existing business types to new categories automatically
