# Frontend-Backend Integration Audit - Fixes Applied

## Audit Summary

Performed comprehensive frontend-to-backend audit covering all components, pages, and hooks. Identified and fixed 9 critical issues related to API authentication, data fetching, and frontend-backend contract mismatches.

---

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: BookingForm - Redundant vendorId Parameter

**File:** `components/booking/BookingForm.tsx`
**Problem:** Frontend sent `vendorId` in booking request body, but backend derives it from the service (security feature). This was redundant data.
**Fix:**

- Removed `vendorId` from request payload
- Added Authorization header to booking creation request
  **Impact:** Cleaner API contract, properly authenticated requests

---

### Issue #2: BookingCalendar - Missing Authorization Headers

**File:** `components/booking/BookingCalendar.tsx`
**Problem:** All API calls (fetch staff, fetch availability) were missing Authorization headers. Backend requires authentication.
**Fix:** Added Authorization headers to:

- Staff list fetch: `/api/staff?vendorId=${vendorId}`
- Specific staff availability: `/api/staff/${staffId}/availability`
- Any staff availability loop
  **Impact:** Requests now properly authenticated, preventing 401 errors

---

### Issue #3: VendorVerificationDashboard - Missing Authorization

**File:** `components/vendor/VendorVerificationDashboard.tsx`
**Problem:** Verification status fetch and document upload requests lacked Authorization headers.
**Fix:** Added Authorization headers to:

- `fetchVerification()` - GET `/api/vendor/verification`
- `handleFileUpload()` - POST `/api/vendor/verification/documents`
  **Impact:** Vendors can now access their verification dashboard without auth failures

---

### Issue #4: StaffManagementDashboard - No Authorization on Fetch

**File:** `components/staff/StaffManagementDashboard.tsx`
**Problem:** Staff fetch, services fetch, and create/update requests all missing Authorization headers.
**Fix:** Added Authorization headers to:

- `fetchStaff()` - GET `/api/staff`
- `fetchServices()` - GET `/api/vendor/services`
- `handleSubmit()` - POST/PUT `/api/staff` and `/api/staff/${id}`
  **Impact:** Complete staff management now works with proper authentication

---

### Issue #5: StaffManagementDashboard - Delete Missing Auth

**File:** `components/staff/StaffManagementDashboard.tsx` (separate fix)
**Problem:** Staff delete request (`handleDelete`) was missing Authorization header.
**Fix:** Added Authorization header to DELETE `/api/staff/${staffId}`
**Impact:** Staff deletion now properly authenticated

---

### Issue #6: CouponApplication - Missing Authorization

**File:** `components/coupons/CouponApplication.tsx`
**Problem:** Coupon availability fetch and validation requests lacked Authorization headers.
**Fix:** Added Authorization headers to:

- `loadAvailableCoupons()` - GET `/api/coupons?customerId=...&vendorId=...`
- `validateCoupon()` - POST `/api/coupons/validate`
  **Impact:** Customers can now view and apply coupons with proper auth

---

### Issue #7: CouponManagement - Missing Authorization

**File:** `components/coupons/CouponManagement.tsx`
**Problem:** Coupon stats fetch and creation requests missing Authorization headers.
**Fix:** Added Authorization headers to:

- Stats fetch: GET `/api/coupons/stats?vendorId=...`
- Create coupon: POST `/api/coupons`
  **Impact:** Vendors can now manage coupons with proper authentication

---

### Issue #8: Bookings Page - Static Placeholder

**File:** `app/bookings/page.tsx`
**Problem:** Page was completely static - showed "No trips booked yet" regardless of actual user bookings. No backend integration.
**Fix:** Complete rewrite with:

- Real API integration: GET `/api/bookings` with Authorization header
- Loading states with spinner
- Error handling with retry capability
- Upcoming/Past bookings tabs
- Detailed booking cards with service info, vendor, datetime, status, price
- Empty state with "Browse Salons" CTA
- Proper routing to individual booking details
  **Impact:** Users can now see their actual bookings, not a placeholder

---

### Issue #9: Favorites Page - Static Placeholder

**File:** `app/favorites/page.tsx`
**Problem:** Page was static - showed "Create your first wishlist" regardless of actual favorites. No backend integration.
**Fix:** Complete rewrite with:

- Real API integration: GET `/api/favorites` with Authorization header
- Loading states with spinner
- Error handling with retry capability
- Display favorited vendors with ServiceCard component
- Remove favorite functionality: DELETE `/api/favorites/${id}`
- Empty state with "Browse Salons" CTA
- Grid layout showing all saved favorites
  **Impact:** Users can now see and manage their actual favorite salons

---

## Authentication Pattern Implemented

All API calls now follow this pattern:

```typescript
const response = await fetch("/api/endpoint", {
  method: "GET|POST|PUT|DELETE",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json", // For POST/PUT
    Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("accessToken")}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data), // For POST/PUT
});
```

---

## Backend Data Contract Validations

### Booking Creation

**Frontend sends:**

```typescript
{
  serviceId: string;
  datetime: string; // ISO format
  notes?: string;
  staffId?: string;
  staffPreference: "any" | "specific";
}
```

**Backend expects:** ✅ MATCHES

- Backend derives `vendorId` from service (security)
- All fields validated with Zod schema

### Staff Management

**Frontend sends (create):**

```typescript
{
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  position: string;
  serviceIds: string[];
  schedule: Record<string, {
    enabled: boolean;
    startTime: string;
    endTime: string;
    breakStart?: string;
    breakEnd?: string;
  }>;
}
```

**Backend expects:** ✅ MATCHES

### Favorites

**Frontend receives:**

```typescript
{
  _id: string;
  vendorId: {
    _id: string;
    businessName: string;
    city?: string;
    rating?: number;
    totalReviews?: number;
    businessType?: string;
    images?: string[];
  };
  createdAt: string;
}
```

**Backend provides:** ✅ MATCHES (with populated vendor data)

### Bookings List

**Frontend receives:**

```typescript
{
  _id: string;
  serviceId: {
    _id: string;
    name: string;
    price: number;
    duration: number;
  };
  vendorId: {
    _id: string;
    businessName: string;
    city?: string;
    businessAddress?: string;
  };
  staffId?: {
    _id: string;
    name: string;
  };
  datetime: string;
  status: "pending" | "confirmed" | "completed" | "cancelled";
  totalPrice: number;
  notes?: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

**Backend provides:** ✅ MATCHES (with populated references)

## Error Handling Improvements

All rewritten pages now include:

1. **Loading States:** Spinner with descriptive text
2. **Error States:** Error message with "Try Again" button
3. **Empty States:** User-friendly message with actionable CTA
4. **Toast Notifications:** Success/error feedback for user actions
5. **Authentication Guards:** Redirect to `/signin` if not authenticated
