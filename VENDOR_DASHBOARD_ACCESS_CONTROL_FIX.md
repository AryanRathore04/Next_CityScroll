# Vendor Dashboard Access Control Fix

## Issue

**Error:** "Authentication required" when trying to add staff from vendor dashboard

**Root Cause:**

- Customer accounts were able to access the vendor dashboard page
- The page didn't have proper user type validation
- When customers tried to use vendor-only features (like adding staff), the API correctly rejected them with 401 Unauthorized

**Logs showing the problem:**

```
userType: 'customer'  ‚Üê Customer logged in
POST /api/staff 401 in 99ms  ‚Üê API rejected customer
üî¥ [MIDDLEWARE] Invalid or expired access token
```

## Solution Implemented

Added multi-layer access control to the vendor dashboard:

### 1. **Early Redirect in useEffect**

When the page loads and detects a customer user:

- Shows alert message explaining the restriction
- Redirects to home page immediately
- Prevents any vendor operations

```tsx
// Redirect customers to home page
if (user.userType === "customer") {
  console.log(
    "‚ö†Ô∏è [DASHBOARD] Customer trying to access vendor dashboard, redirecting...",
  );
  alert(
    "This page is only accessible to vendors. Please sign up as a vendor to access this feature.",
  );
  router.push("/" as Route);
  return;
}

// Only allow vendors and admins
if (user.userType !== "vendor" && user.userType !== "admin") {
  console.log("‚ö†Ô∏è [DASHBOARD] Unauthorized user type:", user.userType);
  router.push("/signin" as Route);
  return;
}
```

### 2. **UI-Level Access Control**

Added a visual "Access Denied" page for non-vendor users:

- Shows clear error message
- Provides helpful actions:
  - Button to go back home
  - Button to sign up as vendor
- Prevents rendering of any vendor dashboard content

```tsx
// Check if user is authorized (vendor or admin only)
if (user && user.userType !== "vendor" && user.userType !== "admin") {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-background flex items-center justify-center p-4">
      <div className="max-w-2xl w-full bg-card rounded-2xl shadow-lg border border-border p-8 text-center">
        <div className="mb-6">
          <div className="mx-auto h-20 w-20 bg-orange-500/10 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">
            <XCircle className="h-10 w-10 text-orange-500" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <h1 className="text-3xl font-heading text-foreground mb-4">
          Access Denied
        </h1>

        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
          This page is only accessible to vendors. Please sign up as a vendor to
          access the vendor dashboard.
        </p>

        <div className="flex gap-3 justify-center">
          <Button onClick={() => router.push("/" as Route)}>Go to Home</Button>
          <Button
            variant="outline"
            onClick={() => router.push("/signup" as Route)}
          >
            Sign Up as Vendor
          </Button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## User Flow After Fix

### Before Fix

1. Customer logs in
2. Somehow navigates to `/vendor-dashboard`
3. Page loads and shows vendor UI
4. Customer tries to add staff
5. ‚ùå API returns 401 error
6. Console error appears

### After Fix

1. Customer logs in
2. Navigates to `/vendor-dashboard`
3. Page loads and immediately checks user type
4. ‚úÖ Shows "Access Denied" page with helpful message
5. ‚úÖ Customer can click "Go to Home" or "Sign Up as Vendor"
6. No confusing errors or broken functionality

## Benefits

### 1. Better Security

- Prevents unauthorized access at page level
- Customers can't even see vendor-only UI
- Reduces unnecessary API calls

### 2. Improved User Experience

- Clear error message explaining why access is denied
- Helpful call-to-action buttons
- No confusing 401 errors in console

### 3. Proper Access Control Layers

```
Layer 1: useEffect redirect (immediate)
    ‚Üì
Layer 2: UI-level check (visual feedback)
    ‚Üì
Layer 3: API-level check (backend security)
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Customer trying to access vendor dashboard gets "Access Denied" page
- [x] Customer sees helpful message and action buttons
- [x] Vendors can still access vendor dashboard normally
- [x] Admins can access vendor dashboard
- [x] Staff creation works for vendors
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Proper redirect flow for unauthorized users

## File Modified

**`app/vendor-dashboard/page.tsx`**

- Added customer redirect in `checkOnboardingStatus()`
- Added unauthorized user type check
- Added "Access Denied" UI component
- Added userType validation for vendor/admin only

## Related API Endpoints

These endpoints already have proper authentication:

- `POST /api/staff` - Requires vendor or admin
- `GET /api/staff` - Requires vendor or admin
- `PUT /api/staff/[id]` - Requires vendor or admin
- `DELETE /api/staff/[id]` - Requires vendor or admin

The API layer is secure - this fix ensures the frontend matches that security.

## How to Test

### Test Case 1: Customer Access

1. Log in as a customer
2. Navigate to `/vendor-dashboard`
3. ‚úÖ Should see "Access Denied" page
4. ‚úÖ Should have buttons to go home or sign up as vendor

### Test Case 2: Vendor Access

1. Log in as a vendor
2. Navigate to `/vendor-dashboard`
3. ‚úÖ Should see vendor dashboard normally
4. ‚úÖ Should be able to add staff members
5. ‚úÖ Should be able to manage services, bookings, etc.

### Test Case 3: Admin Access

1. Log in as an admin
2. Navigate to `/vendor-dashboard`
3. ‚úÖ Should see vendor dashboard
4. ‚úÖ Should have admin-level access

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:

1. **Route Guards** - Middleware to check auth before page loads
2. **Role-Based Routing** - Separate routes for different user types
3. **Permission System** - More granular access control
4. **Audit Logging** - Track unauthorized access attempts
5. **Rate Limiting** - Prevent brute force access attempts

## Notes

- The API endpoints were already secure
- This fix adds frontend protection to match backend security
- No database changes required
- Backward compatible with existing vendor accounts
- Improves overall security posture of the application
