# Booking Datetime Validation Fix

## Problem

After fixing the staff availability issue, the booking creation was failing with:

```
Validation failed: "Booking datetime must be in the future"
```

Even though the user was selecting a future date and time, the validation was rejecting it.

## Root Cause

### 1. **Strict Validation**

The original validation was checking `new Date(dateStr) > new Date()` which requires the booking to be **strictly** in the future. This causes issues when:

- Processing takes a few milliseconds
- Timezone conversions happen
- Network latency occurs

### 2. **Timezone Conversion Issues**

When creating the booking datetime:

```typescript
const bookingDateTime = new Date(selectedDate);
bookingDateTime.setHours(hours, minutes, 0, 0);
```

This creates a date in **local timezone**, but when converted to ISO string with `.toISOString()`, it converts to UTC. Depending on your timezone, this could shift the time.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Relaxed Validation Window (`app/api/bookings/route.ts`)

**Before:**

```typescript
.refine((dateStr) => new Date(dateStr) > new Date(), {
  message: "Booking datetime must be in the future",
})
```

**After:**

```typescript
.refine((dateStr) => {
  const bookingDate = new Date(dateStr);
  const now = new Date();
  // Allow bookings that are at most 5 minutes in the past
  // (to account for timezone/processing delays)
  const fiveMinutesAgo = new Date(now.getTime() - 5 * 60 * 1000);
  return bookingDate > fiveMinutesAgo;
}, {
  message: "Booking datetime must be in the future",
})
```

This allows a 5-minute grace period to account for:

- Network latency
- Processing time
- Timezone conversion edge cases

### 2. Added Client-Side Validation (`components/booking/BookingCalendar.tsx`)

Added validation **before** sending the booking request:

```typescript
// Verify the booking is in the future
if (bookingDateTime <= new Date()) {
  toast({
    title: "Invalid Time",
    description: "Please select a future date and time",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
  return;
}
```

This catches the issue immediately on the client side instead of waiting for the API response.

### 3. Enhanced Logging

**Client-Side:**

```typescript
console.log("Creating booking:", {
  selectedDate: selectedDate.toISOString(),
  selectedTime,
  bookingDateTime: bookingDateTime.toISOString(),
  bookingDateTimeLocal: bookingDateTime.toString(),
  now: new Date().toISOString(),
  isInFuture: bookingDateTime > new Date(),
});
```

**Server-Side:**

```typescript
logger.warn("Validation failed", {
  error: validation.error,
  receivedData: Object.keys(sanitized),
  datetime: sanitized.datetime,
  now: new Date().toISOString(),
});

logger.info("Creating booking", {
  serviceId,
  datetime,
  staffId,
  staffPreference,
  customerId: currentUser?.id,
});
```

This helps debug timezone and validation issues.

## How It Works Now

### Timeline Example:

```
Current time: 2025-10-03 18:13:59 (6:13:59 PM)

✅ Booking for: 2025-10-03 18:30:00 (6:30 PM) - VALID (16 min in future)
✅ Booking for: 2025-10-03 18:10:00 (6:10 PM) - VALID (within 5-min grace period)
❌ Booking for: 2025-10-03 18:00:00 (6:00 PM) - INVALID (more than 5 min in past)
```

### User Flow:

1. User selects date: **October 5, 2025**
2. User selects time: **14:00** (2:00 PM)
3. Client creates datetime: **October 5, 2025 14:00:00** in local timezone
4. Client validates: Is this > current time? ✅ Yes
5. Client sends to API: ISO string (e.g., `2025-10-05T14:00:00.000Z` or with timezone offset)
6. Server validates: Is this > (current time - 5 minutes)? ✅ Yes
7. Booking created successfully! 🎉

## Testing

### 1. Check Browser Console

When you click "Confirm Booking", you should see:

```javascript
Creating booking: {
  selectedDate: "2025-10-05T00:00:00.000Z",
  selectedTime: "14:00",
  bookingDateTime: "2025-10-05T14:00:00.000Z",
  bookingDateTimeLocal: "Sat Oct 05 2025 14:00:00 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)",
  now: "2025-10-03T18:14:00.123Z",
  isInFuture: true
}
```

### 2. Check Server Logs

You should see:

```
info: Creating booking {
  serviceId: "...",
  datetime: "2025-10-05T14:00:00.000Z",
  staffId: "...",
  staffPreference: "any",
  customerId: "..."
}
```

### 3. If Validation Still Fails

Check the logs for:

```
warn: Validation failed {
  errors: [...],
  receivedData: [...],
  datetime: "...",  // What datetime was received?
  now: "..."        // What was the current time?
}
```

Compare the `datetime` and `now` values to see the time difference.

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Please select a future date and time"

**Cause:** You're trying to book a time that's in the past or too close to now
**Solution:** Select a time slot that's at least a few minutes in the future

### Issue: Validation fails on server but passes on client

**Possible Causes:**

1. Network latency - by the time the request reaches server, the time has passed
2. Server/client clock mismatch
3. Timezone conversion shifting time backwards

**Solution:** The 5-minute grace period should handle most cases, but if you're in a timezone far ahead of UTC (like Asia), you might need to adjust

### Issue: Time showing in wrong timezone

**Not a problem!** The system handles this automatically:

- Client shows times in local timezone (user-friendly)
- Server stores times in UTC (consistent)
- When displaying bookings, convert UTC back to local time

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/bookings/route.ts` - Relaxed validation, added logging
2. `components/booking/BookingCalendar.tsx` - Added client-side validation and logging

## Next Steps

1. **Test the booking flow** again
2. **Check browser console** for the datetime logs
3. **Check server logs** for validation details
4. **If still failing**, share the console logs showing the datetime comparison
